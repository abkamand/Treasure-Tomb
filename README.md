Installation
Part 1: Installing a Python IDE
In order to play Treasure Tomb, you need to have an IDE for Python. If you do not have one, the
preferred IDE for ease of use is PyCharm (VScode works well too!). If you already have an IDE,
please skip to the next part. If you don’t have an IDE for Python:
1. Navigate to https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows
2. Download the appropriate installation based on your operating system
3. Follow the installation instructions

Part 2 : Installing packages
Treasure Tomb requires 2 packages that are not already built-in. These are colorama (used to
color-code text) and pickle (used to save and load data). In Pycharm, you can easily install
these packages by right-clicking the package name at the top of main.py and clicking “install
package”. However, if you are not using Pycharm or want an alternative method, this is the
common way to install Python packages:
1. Go to your command prompt
2. Type in pip install colorama and press Enter
3. This will install colorama to your Python installation
4. Do the same for pickles (pip install pickle)
5. This will install both packages, which will now be usable in your IDE.

Part 3 : Playing the game
1. Treasure Tomb is played in your IDE. In order to play the game, extract the files of the
game from the zip file provided.
2. Make sure that all of the extracted files are in the same directory
3. Open up main.py in your IDE.
4. Run main.py
5. Enjoy Treasure Tomb!
